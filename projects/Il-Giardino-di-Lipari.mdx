## Introduction
Deeply rooted in Sicilian tradition and flavors, _Il Giardino di Lipari_ is a bar nestled within a lush garden on the island of Lipari, in the heart of the Aeolian Islands.
This rebranding project aims to preserve those roots while exploring contemporary solutions that reflect the brand’s natural evolution, enhancing its iconic identity.

The new logo draws inspiration from the&nbsp;previous&nbsp;one, simplifying its form to&nbsp;enhance legibility and&nbsp;convey a&nbsp;more contemporary&nbsp;look. The final “O” in _Giardino_ symbolizes both the crown of a tree — a&nbsp;nod to the original logo — and the sun, an&nbsp;emblem of Sicily and the&nbsp;Mediterranean spirit.

The color palette is deeply rooted in the context of Il Giardino di Lipari, as it consists of&nbsp;_Garden Green_, _Mandarancio Orange_, _Amarena Red_ and&nbsp;_Marine Blue_. These vibrant colors reflect the lush surroundings, local flavors and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Mediterranean atmosphere of the bar.

As we can see, a simplified version of&nbsp;the&nbsp;logo was also designed for smaller-scale applications — such as social&nbsp;media posts, flyers and&nbsp;business cards — ensuring clear recognition and&nbsp;visual coherence across every touchpoint.

The brand identity finds large-scale expression in posters and billboards – especially placed in&nbsp;tourists' hometowns such as Milan – promoting concerts held at the garden during summer.

For special events, such as concerts organized in collaboration with venues outside Sicily, the&nbsp;communication keeps the same visual energy adapting to new contexts. The flyers maintain the recognizable palette and typographic style while promoting _Il Giardino di Lipari_’s catering and cultural presence beyond the island.
