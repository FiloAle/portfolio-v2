## Introduction
HEEP is a speculative design project that aims to raise awareness on the potatoes overproduction through a combination of a physical object and a digital platform.

<h2 id="speculative-context">Speculative context</h2>

As every speculative design project does, HEEP lives in its own futuristic but plausible context too.
Its name stands for _Holding for the Electrical Energy from Potatoes_ and it consists in a fictionary company that aims to solve,
at&nbsp;least in part, the potato overproduction problem. Every year, in fact, we waste more than 57mln tons of spuds, but we also
know that potatoes contain an acid that can lead to the exchange of electrons between a copper and a zinc electrodes,
resulting in the production of small electric charges. Because of this specific principle, HEEP developed Qubo, a domestic electricity generator powered by potatoes. Activate your audio and watch the brand reel that sums it up down below!

<h2 id="brand-identity">Brand identity</h2>

HEEP's identity, as you've probably already seen from the previous video, aims to reach the broadest audience possible by adopting
a&nbsp;colorful visual communication and a catchy tone of voice in its copywrite. The main goal, in&nbsp;fact, is&nbsp;involving the greatest number
of&nbsp;people in HEEP's community, in&nbsp;order to save as many potatoes as&nbsp;possible from being&nbsp;wasted.

HEEP's users from all over the world are able to contribute to the cause by buying and using Qubo, powering on their favorite modules and lighting up their homes
while helping the global community, at the same&nbsp;time, in reaching its&nbsp;goal.

As we can see, HEEP’s social communication embraces a colorful and ironic tone, combining transparency with playfulness to engage&nbsp;users and bring them closer to the brand’s mission. This witty tone can be found&nbsp;across all the communication artifacts from&nbsp;HEEP, the&nbsp;products' packagings and the&nbsp;web application, fostering&nbsp;a&nbsp;brand&nbsp;coherency.

<h2 id="arduino-and-webapp">Arduino and Webapp</h2>

We, as HEEP, have also realized a proper working prototype of Qubo using Arduino and other technologies such as PHP to create the relative&nbsp;WebApp.
More&nbsp;specifically, I've managed to develop the software that powers it&nbsp;all. Here you can take a look at some pictures and code snippets from the&nbsp;project:

<RoundedImage

  title={`Functioning Qubo prototype`}
  src={`/HEEP/qubo_2.avif`}
/>

```cpp
if(digitalRead(15) == HIGH) {
  if(firstLaunch) {
    sendData("api_key=" + apiKeyValue
            + "&action=ins"
            + "&sessionid=" + currentID
            + "&genkp=" + genkp
            + "&npot=" + npot);

    savedData.begin("IDs", false);
    currentID = savedData.getInt("lastID") + 1;
    savedData.putInt("lastID", currentID);
    savedData.end();

    displayFirstPage();

    firstLaunch = false;
  }
  ...
}
```

This is an extract of code from QuboScreen, a module of the prototype based on ESP32 (the orange one in the previous picture) that sends Qubo's electric
production data to&nbsp;a&nbsp;database. The database has a key role in making the experience feel complete, in fact it&nbsp;stores a series of&nbsp;informations that every
user can freely access from their personal area on <a>heepenergia.it</a> (which is no longer available), a sort of a WebApp optimized for mobile
displays. By&nbsp;registering on the website, each user is able associate their personal Qubo usage session with their own account and see the statistics
being updated in real time, thanks to QuboScreen and its&nbsp;database&nbsp;integration.

Down below, on the other hand, you can read a snippet of PHP code from the login page that checks users'&nbsp;data.

```php
if(isset($_SESSION['userid'])) {
  header('location:user_page.php');
}

if(isset($_POST['login'])) {
  $username = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['username']);
  $pass = md5($_POST['password']);

  $select = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' && password = '$pass'";
  $result = mysqli_query($conn, $select);

  if(mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {
    $userData = $result->fetch_array();

    $_SESSION['username'] = $userData['username'];
    $_SESSION['userid'] = $userData['userid'];
    header('location:user_page.php');
  } else {
    $error[] = 'Wrong username or password.';
  }
};
```

<p className="!mb-0">This code, specifically, was executed when pressing the login button: in&nbsp;the first instance it&nbsp;checked whether the&nbsp;user was already logged in or not,
and then it stored in two variables their username and password (hashed using the MD5 algorithm) in order to execute a SELECT query on the database and check the&nbsp;credentials. 
If correct, the&nbsp;website would have displayed the&nbsp;homepage, otherwise it would have shown an error&nbsp;message.</p>
