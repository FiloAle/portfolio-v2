## Introduction
_Libra_ is a connected smart vase that automates plant care through sensors and a _companion app_. It manages watering autonomously while offering insights and gentle reminders, fostering a mindful connection between people, technology and nature.

<h2 id="3d-modelling">3D modelling</h2>

The 3D modelling process of Libra was carried out using _Blender_, and aimed to&nbsp;balance functionality with aesthetics ensuring that every functional element, from&nbsp;the&nbsp;water system to the electronic board, seamlessly fit within a&nbsp;minimal&nbsp;silhouette.

The internal structure includes a ceramic upper vase, a water nebulizer with sponge, a central water tank and&nbsp;a&nbsp;light&#x2011;integrated base which hosts a control board managing the system.

The water tank can be refilled directly from above the base (between the colored clay vase and the bioplastic base), preserving the _natural gesture of watering_ without requiring any disassembly.
Designed with simple lines and neutral materials, Libra fits seamlessly into any interior environment.

<h2 id="mobile-app-prototyping">Mobile app prototyping</h2>

The mobile app prototype was developed in Figma, and the design process explored the entire flow from onboarding to plant management.
During the first login, users are guided through a brief welcoming phase that includes a&nbsp;Wi&#x2011;Fi&nbsp;scan to&nbsp;detect and&nbsp;connect existing Libra vases on the network.

The app is divided into two main sections: _Home_ and _Care_. The Home screen, titled “Your garden,” provides&nbsp;an&nbsp;overview of all connected vases, showing battery levels, remaining water, and quick access to each unit’s controls.
Tapping on a vase opens a detailed overlay with real-time data and&nbsp;management options such as light and&nbsp;watering settings. From this view, users can also add new plants or vases to their account.
