## Introduction
_The Cost of AI_ is a virtual reality experience in&nbsp;which the player becomes the "conscience" of&nbsp;an&nbsp;artificial intelligence. Inside a servers room, the player needs to accept or deny a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;prompts received from different users from all over the&nbsp;world. Each choice influences the system’s stability and water&nbsp;consumption, reflecting these changes on&nbsp;the surrounding&nbsp;environment.
The experience aims to raise awareness about the unseen environmental footprint of modern AI models and encourages a more conscious relationship with&nbsp;them.

The project was conceived at a time when generative AI was rapidly expanding with new features, such as image generation on ChatGPT, and even occasional system overloads (e.g. due to the Studio Ghibli styled pictures trend).
That&nbsp;moment sparked a question: what’s the real cost behind this apparent abundance? _The Cost of AI_ transforms that question into an experience, letting players confront the trade-off between creativity, efficiency, and environmental impact.
In&nbsp;this&nbsp;immersive experience, through a Meta&nbsp;Quest headset, the&nbsp;player gets teleported into a&nbsp;servers&nbsp;room, representing an AI's conscience.

At the center of the room, there's a console: here the received prompts are show in&nbsp;form of&nbsp;translucent spheres.
The&nbsp;player can&nbsp;then read them and pick them up using their&nbsp;hands, and&nbsp;choose whether to&nbsp;discard or&nbsp;accept&nbsp;them. The&nbsp;minigame's goal is to balance the requests, keeping the environment under control. Accepting a&nbsp;large amount of&nbsp;prompts makes the
servers room overheat, while rejecting too many leads the servers to freeze and the AI to "die".

Developed with Unity and modeled entirely in _Blender_, the experience merges 3D design with interactive programming.
Through C# scripting, we defined the system’s logic and its dynamic balance between heat and&nbsp;water&nbsp;consumption.
Thanks to the Meta Quest SDK, players&nbsp;are&nbsp;able to use their hands, instead of controllers, to&nbsp;grab and&nbsp;manage&nbsp;prompts, blurring the boundary between physical gesture and digital consequence.

We tested the experience with a group of users, observing how they interacted with the system and interpreted its&nbsp;rules.
Their feedback revealed some moments of confusion and helped us improve the gestures and responses, turning the learning curve into a more fluid, natural process.

<p className="!mb-0">The experience concludes with a printed report, a&nbsp;tangible trace of the player’s&nbsp;choices.
Alongside personal performance metrics, it&nbsp;presents the&nbsp;actual resource consumption of major AI companies, bridging the gap between virtual responsibility and&nbsp;real-world consequences.</p>
